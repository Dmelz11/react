           My name is David Melendez and I am happily married to my partner Laura and we have two sons, Elijah and Daniel.
          Laura and I are living on the Southern Oregon coast after living on a small farm in the Cascades for many years. 
          I have been working primarily in construction as a general contractor specializing in residential design/build projects.
          Most recently I have  been studying web development and have attended UC Berkeley's Full Stack web devopment Bootcamp 
          where I received an intensive immersion into the tools and methods of the Mern stack. It is my hope to continue to
          improve my web development skills and to eventually work in the field.
